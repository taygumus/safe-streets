# SafeStreets Project

## General Purpose

SafeStreets is a crowdsourced application where citizens can report traffic violations to authorities along with pictures and relevant information about the infractions. After validation, if requested, the system provides the possibility to analyze the collected data based on the role of the final user.  
In addition, SafeStreets can cross-reference its information with data provided by the municipality and suggest reasonable interventions for unsafe areas. It can also supply public authorities, such as the local police, with data to generate traffic tickets. Finally, it elaborates statistics on different layers to show the effectiveness of SafeStreets and its impact on the community.

## Documentation

The project documentation is structured into two main parts:

1. **Requirement Analysis and Specification Document**

2. **Design Document**

## Languages and Tools Used

- **Alloy**: Utilized as a declarative specification language. Alloy models are analyzed using [Alloy Analyzer](https://alloytools.org).

- **UML**: Used for creating various diagrams for analysis. UML diagrams are created with [StarUML](https://staruml.io/).

Details about Alloy models and UML diagrams present in the documentation can be found in their respective folders.
